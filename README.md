# audiosalad-xml

Slingshot uses AudioSalad to power our delivery process. This library adapts AudioSalad's custom XML specification to a JavaScript- and TypeScript-friendly form, providing classes that easily allow you to generate AudioSalad-compatible XML for releases, tracks, and more.

Install the package to get started:
> npm install @ssh/audiosalad-xml --save

## Basic Usage
Create a new `Release` with relevant fields. Call `.xml()` on a `Release` or any other similar object to generate AudioSalad-compatible XML.
